## Database + SQL_Fundamentals

>#### In Brief
> 1. Do you have Useful data?
> 2. Install a DB to Store Data
> 3. Use SQL to Setup + Use Data


- SQL Playground
  - [ db-fiddle.com ](db-fiddle.com) __->__ We are goinf to use this for Quick DB query 


## SQL
- Structured Query Language
- With SQL,we are mainly talking to a Database
- It is the language ,statements that will help us achieve it,it is callee Query

 #### Query
- SQL STATEMENT 
> SELECT * FROM USERS 
> When we execute this statement .we select all the USERS
- QUERY BREAKDOWN
> SELECT NAME      --> clause,  NAME is identifier
> FROM USERS       --> clause
> WHERE ROLE = "MANAGAER"    --> WHERE is keyword ,ROLE="MANAGAER" is condition

###### SQL is a Declarative Language
- Explanation:
    - What will Happen  __->__ DECLARATIVE __->__ SQL
    - How it will Happen  __->__ IMPERATIVE __-->__ GOING LINE BY LINE __->__ JAVA
         - PYTHON __->__  DECLARATIVE AND IMPERATIVE


##### IBM __->__ SQL_ORIGIN 
 - Founder - Ted Codd(relational Model) -->  Inspired -->CJ Date
-  1975 - Don Chamberlin & Raymond Boyce 


#### SQL Standards
- SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in *1986*, 
- and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in *1987*



### Database-Models
- Hirarchial
- Networking
- Entity-Relationship
- Relational
- Object-Oriented
- Flat
- Semi-Structured

#### Hierarchial Model
- The Data is tightly coupled between parent and child
- It is inefficient and explains only "1 to may relationship"

#### Relational Model
- Relationship is established in simple way
- It is efficient  and we can use "linking"

### DBMS - Revisited
- This is a SOFTWARE that helps to CREATE,READ,UPDATE AND DELETE the DATA 
- In addition to this: 
   - Manage the Data
   - Secure the Data
   - Transaction Management
   - Make Data accessible

##### WHO MAKES IT?
- Companies make it and are competitive
  - ORACLE
  - IBM
  - MICROSOFT
